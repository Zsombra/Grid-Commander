# Journal

Session handoff log. **Newest entry at the top**, directly under this header.

Every session that changes anything ends with an entry here. This is what a
fresh agent — or you in three weeks — reads to know where things stand and what
the last session learned the hard way.

Format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — one-line summary of the session

**Did**: what actually changed. Name changes, items, files.
**State**: what is in flight right now and how far along.
**Next**: the single next action, named as a command or skill.
**Watch out**: gotchas, dead ends, decisions that are not obvious from the diff.
```

Only `## YYYY-MM-DD — summary` headings are parsed; everything else is free text.
Write `**Watch out**: none` rather than dropping the line — an empty field is a
signal, a missing one is ambiguous.

Read it with `python3 .claude/tools/openspec.py journal --limit 5`, or see it
folded into `board`.

**Merge conflicts** are expected here when two sessions run in parallel, and the
resolution is always the same: keep both entries, newest first.

## 2026-07-27 — Spec layer merged; tracking system added (v3.0)

**Did**: Merged OpenSpec's data model into the pipeline — `openspec/specs/` as
source of truth, delta specs, change folders, archive-merge, tracks. Added the
tracking layer: `openspec/backlog/`, this journal, and the `board` command.
Opened PR #1.

**State**: Harness v3.0 on branch `claude/harness-openspec-merge-smkspq`. No
application code exists yet — this repo is the harness itself. Backlog is empty.

**Next**: `/board` at the start of the next session, then `/propose` the first
real change.

**Watch out**: The two directories named "spec" are different things —
`openspec/specs/` is behavior, `docs/specs/` is review checklists. Never edit
`openspec/specs/` by hand during a change; the archiver writes it.
